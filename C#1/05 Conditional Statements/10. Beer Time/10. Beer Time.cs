//Problem 10.* Beer Time
//• A beer time is after  1:00 PM  and before  3:00 AM .
//• Write a program that enters a time in format “hh:mm tt”
//(an hour in range [01...12], a minute in range [00…59] and AM / PM 
//designator) and prints  beer time  or  non-beer time  according to
//the definition above or  invalid time  if the time cannot be parsed.
//Note: You may need to learn how to parse dates and times. 

//Examples:
//time        result
//1:00 PM     beer time 
//4:30 PM     beer time 
//10:57 PM    beer time 
//8:30 AM     non-beer time 
//02:59 AM    beer time 
//03:00 AM    non-beer time 
//03:26 AM    non-beer time 

class Beer_Time
{
    static void Main()
    {
        //За звездичките не ми остана време...
    }
