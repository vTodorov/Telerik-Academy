//Problem 12.* Zero Subset
//• We are given 5 integer numbers. Write a program that finds all subsets of these numbers whose sum is 0.
//• Assume that repeating the same subset several times is not a problem.

//Examples:
//numbers         result
//3 -2 1 1 8      -2 + 1 + 1 = 0 

//3 1 -7 35 22    no zero subset 

//1 3 -4 -2 -1    1 + -1 = 0 
//                1 + 3 + -4 = 0 
//                3 + -2 + -1 = 0 

//1 1 1 -1        -1 1 + -1 = 0 
//                1 + 1 + -1 + -1 = 0 

//0 0 0 0 0       0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 

//Hint: you may check for zero each of the 32 subsets with 32  if  statements.
