//Problem 2. Bonus Score
//• Write a program that applies bonus score to given score in the range  [1…9]  
//by the following rules: ◦ If the score is between  1  and  3 , the program multiplies it by  10 .
//◦ If the score is between  4  and  6 , the program multiplies it by  100 .
//◦ If the score is between  7  and  9 , the program multiplies it by  1000 .
//◦ If the score is  0  or more than  9 , the program prints  “invalid score” .

//Examples:
//score       result
//2           20 
//4           400 
//9           9000 
//-1          invalid score 
//10          invalid score
