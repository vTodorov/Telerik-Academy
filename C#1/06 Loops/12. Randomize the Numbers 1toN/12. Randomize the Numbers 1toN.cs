//Problem 12.* Randomize the Numbers 1…N
//• Write a program that enters in integer  n  and prints the numbers 
//1, 2, …, n  in random order.

//Examples:
//n       randomized numbers 1…n
//3       2 1 3 
//10      3 4 8 2 6 7 9 1 10 5 

//Note: The above output is just an example. Due to randomness, 
//your program most probably will produce different results. 
//You might need to use arrays.

class Randomize_the_Numbers_1_N
{
    static void Main()
    {
       //няма никой :) *
    }
