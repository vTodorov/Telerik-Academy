//Problem 18.* Trailing Zeroes in N!
//• Write a program that calculates with how many zeroes the factorial
//of a given number  n  has at its end.
//• Your program should work well for very big numbers, e.g.  n=100000 .

//Examples:
//n       trailing zeroes of n!       explaination
//10      2                           3628800 
//20      4                           2432902008176640000 
//100000  24999                       think why
