/*
Homework: Primitive Data Types and Variables
Problem 1. Declare Variables

Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of the types
byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong to represent the following values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000.
Choose a large enough type for each number to ensure it will fit in it. Try to compile the code.

using System;

class Variables
{
    static void Main()
    {
        ushort unsignedShort = 52130;
        sbyte signedByte = -115;
        int integer = 4825932;
        byte smallNumber = 97;
        short shortNumber = -10000;
    }
